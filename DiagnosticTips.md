# Introduction #
There are various ways to discover facets of the behaviour of a Mobile Analytics library. These include observation, stimulating the library e.g. by starting, pausing and stopping the library, and by making calls to the library.

Virtually all the libraries will send data over an internet connection. Therefore we can monitor the network connection to detect some aspects of the behaviour, particularly messages sent and received.

Sometimes we can seed the device with certain characteristics, data, profiles, configurations, etc. to determine whether and when the mobile analytics library uses that data e.g. to send to the server when the library is initiated at runtime.

We can observe other characteristics e.g. memory run-time characteristics using other utilities.

with some of the Mobile Analytics software they provide the server-side software too. When we have access to the server we can configure the web server (etc) to generate logs that contain pertinent data.
