Mobile Analytics is becoming more popular and pervasive.

Many mobile apps include Mobile Analytics code, often written by another organisation. This external code may be provided as a binary library where the behaviour is opaque. When we understand, can predict, and configure the behaviour we increase the ability to use the library effectively with fewer undesirable behaviours or side-effects.

Another aim is to protect the privacy of the end-users and the information & data on their devices.

We can then choose to use Mobile Analytics to provide actionable information about how our app is behaving from the perspectives of software qualities.
